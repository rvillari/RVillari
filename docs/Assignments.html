<div id="assignment-1" class="section level1">
<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<p><strong>Collaborators: Sara Whitelaw, Halle Wasser </strong></p>
<div id="problem-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 1</h3>
<p>Install the datasets package on the console below using <code>install.packages("datasets")</code>. Now load the library.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(datasets)</code></pre>
<p>Load the USArrests dataset and rename it <code>dat</code>. Note that this dataset comes with R, in the package datasets, so there’s no need to load data from your computer. Why is it useful to rename the dataset?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dat&lt;-USArrests</code></pre>
<p>It is useful to rename the dataset because it makes the file easier to access and use in later coding functions.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 2</h3>
<p>Use this command to make the state names into a new variable called State.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dat$state &lt;- tolower(rownames(USArrests))</code></pre>
<p>This dataset has the state names as row names, so we just want to make them into a new variable. We also make them all lower case, because that will help us draw a map later - the map function requires the states to be lower case.</p>
<p>List the variables contained in the dataset <code>USArrests</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>names(dat)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Murder&quot;   &quot;Assault&quot;  &quot;UrbanPop&quot; &quot;Rape&quot;     &quot;state&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The variables are Murder, Assault, UrbanPop, and Rape.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 3</h3>
<p>What type of variable (from the DVB chapter) is <code>Murder</code>?</p>
<p>Answer: Quantitative Variable</p>
<p>What R Type of variable is it?</p>
<p>Answer: Numeric in a list form</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 4</h3>
<p>What information is contained in this dataset, in general? What do the numbers mean?</p>
<p>Answer: This data set gives us information on the frequency of murder, assault, and rape arrests per 100,000 residents in each state of the US in 1973. It also gives information on the percent of the population living in urban areas of each state.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-5" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 5</h3>
<p>Draw a histogram of <code>Murder</code> with proper labels and title.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(dat$Murder,main=&quot;Histogram of Murder Arrests in 1973&quot;, xlab=&quot;Murder Arrests In A State per 100,000 Residents&quot;, ylab=&quot;Frequency&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Assignments_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
<div id="problem-6" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 6</h3>
<p>Please summarize <code>Murder</code> quantitatively. What are its mean and median? What is the difference between mean and median? What is a quartile, and why do you think R gives you the 1st Qu. and 3rd Qu.?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(dat$Murder)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##   0.800   4.075   7.250   7.788  11.250  17.400</code></pre>
<p>The mean of the Murder data is 7.788 and the median is 7.25. The mean is the average value of the data set. In other words, the mean is all of the numbers in a data set added together and then divided by the total amount of numbers present in the set. In contrast, the median is the middle value of the data when the numerical data values are ordered from least to greatest. Quartiles of a data set are the 3 values that divide the observed data into even fourths. R gives the 1st and 3rd quartiles to give us insight into the spread of our data.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-7" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 7</h3>
<p>Repeat the same steps you followed for <code>Murder</code>, for the variables <code>Assault</code> and <code>Rape</code>. Now plot all three histograms together. You can do this by using the command <code>par(mfrow=c(3,1))</code> and then plotting each of the three.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(dat$Assault,main=&quot;Histogram of Assault Arrests in USA in 1973&quot;, xlab=&quot;Assault Arrests In A State per 100,000 Residents&quot;, ylab=&quot;Frequency&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Assignments_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="480" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(dat$Assault)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##    45.0   109.0   159.0   170.8   249.0   337.0</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(dat$Rape,main=&quot;Histogram of Rape Arrests in USA in 1973&quot;, xlab=&quot;Rape Arrests In A State per 100,000 Residents&quot;, ylab=&quot;Frequency&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Assignments_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-2.png" width="480" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(dat$Rape)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##    7.30   15.07   20.10   21.23   26.18   46.00</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>par(mfrow=c(3,1))
hist(dat$Murder,main=&quot;Histogram of Murder Arrests in USA in 1973&quot;, xlab=&quot;Murder Arrests per 100,000 Residents In A State&quot;, ylab=&quot;Frequency&quot;)
hist(dat$Assault,main=&quot;Histogram of Assault Arrests in USA in 1973&quot;, xlab=&quot;Assault Arrests per 100,000 Residents In A State&quot;, ylab=&quot;Frequency&quot;)
hist(dat$Rape,main=&quot;Histogram of Rape Arrests in USA in 1973&quot;, xlab=&quot;Rape Arrests per 100,000 Residents In A State&quot;, ylab=&quot;Frequency&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Assignments_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-3.png" width="480" /></p>
<p>The mean value for Assault is 170.76 and the median value is 159. The mean value for Rape is 21.232 and the median value is 20.1</p>
<p>What does the command par do, in your own words (you can look this up by asking R <code>?par</code>)?</p>
<p>Answer: par is used to set or query graphical parameters.</p>
<p>What can you learn from plotting the histograms together?</p>
<p>Answer: We can see that the histograms for Murder and Rape Arrests skew to the left. We can also see that that there are more Assault arrests than Rape arrests, and more Rape arrests than Murder arrests.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-8" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 8</h3>
<p>In the console below (not in text), type <code>install.packages("maps")</code> and press Enter, and then type <code>install.packages("ggplot2")</code> and press Enter. This will install the packages so you can load the libraries.</p>
<p>Run this code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&#39;maps&#39;) 
library(&#39;ggplot2&#39;) 

ggplot(dat, aes(map_id=state, fill=Murder)) + 
  geom_map(map=map_data(&quot;state&quot;)) + 
  expand_limits(x=map_data(&quot;state&quot;)$long, y=map_data(&quot;state&quot;)$lat)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Assignments_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="720" /></p>
<p>What does this code do? Explain what each line is doing.</p>
<p>Answer: The install.packages command allows us to download and install packages from CRAN-like repositories or from local files. The library command allows one to add the functions installed from the package mentioned above into one’s library so that s/he can use those functions when coding. Lastly, the ggplot command initializes a ggplot object. It can be used to “declare the input data frame for a graphic and the specify the set of plot aesthetics intended to be common throughout all subsequent layers unless specifically overridden” (R). Overall, this set of commands creates a graph showing the frequency of murder arrests in each state, with darker blues corresponding to higher frequencies.</p>

<h3>Problem 2</h3>
<p>List the variables contained in the dataset.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>names(dat)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;mjage&quot;     &quot;cigage&quot;    &quot;iralcage&quot;  &quot;age2&quot;      &quot;sexatract&quot; &quot;speakengl&quot;
## [7] &quot;irsex&quot;</code></pre>
<p><strong>The variables in this dataset are named mjage, cigage, iralcage, age2, sexatract, speakengl, and irsex.“mjage” gives information on the age at which a respondent first used marijuana or hashish. “cigage” gives information on how old the respondent was when s/he began smoking cigarettes every day. “iralcage” gives the age at which a respondent first tried alcohol. “age2” gives information on the final edited age of the respondent. The age is considered “edited” because there were multiple consistency checks throughout the questionnaire in which the respondent could provide different ages. “irsex” tells us the sex of the respondent (either male or female). “sexatract” provides information on the sexual orientation of the respondent. “speakengl” gives information on how well the respondent speaks English.</strong></p>
<p>What is this dataset about? Who collected the data, what kind of sample is it, and what was the purpose of generating the data? <strong>Answer:</strong> <strong>This dataset gives information about NSDUH, a household interview survey of substance use, substance use disorders, mental health, and the receipt of treatment services for these disorders in the US.It was collected face-to-face by “field interviewers” who asked questions about less sensitive topics, and then directed respondents to a computer self-interviewing program for more sensitive topics. This dataset collected information from the civilian, noninstitutionalized population, aged 12 or older in all 50 states of the US and DC.The purpose of this dataset is to provide insight into substance use and mental health issues in the US. Doing so helps guide policy directions in addressing things such as problem substances, prevalence of mental illnesses, intersection of substance use and mental illness, and helps agencies make decisions about what types of resources are needed and where resources should be directed.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="problem-3-age-and-gender" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 3: Age and gender</h3>
<p>What is the age distribution of the sample like? Make sure you read the codebook to know what the variable values mean.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(dat$age2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##    4.00   13.00   15.00   13.98   15.00   17.00</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(dat$age2,main=&quot;Age Distribution of NSDUH Survey Sample&quot;, xlab=&quot;Age according to codebook&quot;, ylab=&quot;Frequency&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Assignments_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="672" /> <strong>The range of this data is from 12 years old (corresponding to “1” in the dataset) to 65+ years old (“17” in the dataset). The median age of this dataset is between 35 to 49 years old, and the mean is somewhere between 30 to 34 years old. However, since the data is skewed towards the higher values in this dataset, the median gives better insight into the data distribution. Overall, the distribution of this sample shows a continuous increase in frequency of age when going from 12 to 49 years old, but then dramatically decreases after 49 years old.</strong></p>
<p>Do you think this age distribution is representative of the US population? Why or why not? <strong>I do not think that this age distribution is representative of the US population. For one, any participant that was under 18 was required to have a parent or guardian present for the survey. This definitely could have skewed the sample population, as it would have required availability of both the parents and young adults. Another factor pointing to why this distribution is not representative of the US population is the fact that the proportion of 35 to 49 year old respondents is more than 10-100x that of 12 year olds. This distribution is not plausible in the real world, as older aged subjects are more at risk for life threatening illnesses than 12 year olds. So, if anything, the proportion of ages would be reversed (but still not as large as the one seen in the data’s distribution)</strong></p>
<p>Is the sample balanced in terms of gender? If not, are there more females or males?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(dat$irsex,main=&quot;Reported Sex of Respondents&quot;, xlab=&quot;Sex&quot;, ylab=&quot;Frequency&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Assignments_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>mean(dat$irsex)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1.467836</code></pre>
<p><strong>The sample has slightly more male respondents than female respondents. This can be determined by the histogram, which shows a frequency a little over at for males and a frequency of almost 80 for females. We can also tell that the sample has more males than females because the mean is around 1.468 – a value just slightly under the average of 1 + 2 (1.5).</strong></p>
<p>Use this code to draw a stacked bar plot to view the relationship between sex and age. What can you conclude from this plot?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tab.agesex &lt;- table(dat$irsex, dat$age2)
barplot(tab.agesex,
        main = &quot;Stacked Barchart of Sex by Age&quot;,
        xlab = &quot;Age category&quot;, ylab = &quot;Frequency&quot;,
        legend.text = rownames(tab.agesex),
        beside = FALSE) # Stacked bars (default)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Assignments_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="672" /> <strong>This plot tells us a couple things. First, the highest number of respondents were from the age group of 35 to 49 years old and, of this age range, approximately half of the respondents were male and half were female. Additionally, we can see that almost every age category has roughly equal ratios of male to female respondents. Some notable exceptions to this observation are in the 19 and 20 year old groups, which have more females than males and age groups 12-18, which have more male to female respondents. We also see a higher proportion of male:female respondents in the 30-34 and 65+ age groups. Overall, we can conclude that the age distribution skews to the left, with higher ages having a higher number of respondents and, as stated above, all ages have roughly equal ratios of male:female respondents.</strong></p>

The distribution shows that by far the highest proportion of respondents reported their sexual attraction as “I am only attracted to the opposite sex”, or code “1”. There were also respondents who reported either the codes 85,94,97,98 or 99, which excluded them from this question one way or another. Since these responses do not give insight into the sexual orientation of the respondents, these values have been deemed “NA” and therefore do not show in the histogram.</strong></p>

<p><img src="Assignments_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="672" /> <strong>The distribution of English speaking in the sample shows that almost all participants responded that they speak English “Very well” (coded as “1”). We also see that the lowest English Proficiency rating given (3) corresponded to speaking “Not Well” rather than the lowest possible response, 4, which would have corresponded to “Not at all”. I think that this distribution is what I would expect for this sample, as the surveys were conducted only in English or Spanish, which limits the possible respondent pool, as you cannot give a survey to someone who doesn’t understand the language it is given in. However, I think that a random sample of the US population would probably show a little bit more of a spread, with some people responding “4”, and more people responding “2” or “3” than we see in the sample distribution.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We see that the age distribution skews slightly to the left, with the median age being 35 years old. This distribution is what I would expect to see, as it is more likely for younger, middle-aged people (around 25-40) to be suspected of committing a crime and/or as dangerous than it is for very young children or older adults to be suspected as such. Note that missing values (NA in the dataset) were unable to be excluded from this histogram, which is why there are some values reported as “0” even though the youngest age included in the dataset was 6.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Since the data is skewed, it is preferable to use the median to understand the center of age distribution.This is because, for unimodal skewed distributions, the mean is farther in the direction of the pulled out tail than the median is.

<p><strong>We see that there are way more male (6298) than female (293) victims in this sample.

<p><em>Hint 1: The categories along the x-axis are the options for “flee”, each bar contains information about whether the police officer had a body camera (vertically), and the height along the y-axis shows the frequency of that category).</em></p>
<p><em>Hint 2: Also, if you are unsure about the syntax for barplot, run ?barplot in R and see some examples at the bottom of the documentation. This is usually a good way to look up the syntax of R code. You can also Google it.</em></p>

<p><strong>We can see that in every case, whether the victim was fleeing by car, foot, other, or not fleeing, the proportion of officers NOT wearing a body camera (dark grey) is much higher than the proportion of officers who were wearing a body camera (light grey). This is not surprising, as earlier we found out that only about 14% of cases in this dataset reported that officers were wearing a body camera. Thus, we would expect the proportion of officers wearing body cameras in the context of whether or not the victim was fleeing to be very small across the board. Note that the first column in this stacked bar plot references missing values for how/if the victim fled. Although this data was missing, it still shows the same relationship to body camera proportion as the other columns. Overall, we can conclude that regardless of the fleeing type, the proportion of officers wearing a body camera is very low.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Police killings are most likely mislabelled or underreported due to the fact that police forces want to keep this data hush hush.

<p><strong>Since we do not see a clear pattern or clumping in the residuals vs x plot, I believe it is safe to assume that that independence assumption is met for this data set.The line showing the average value of the residuals at each value of fitted value is pretty flat, which means there is no discernible non-linear trend to the residuals; we can therefore assume linearity. We see almost a flat line in the scale-location plot, meaning that the errors in the data have constant variance; the homoscedasticity assumption is met. The leverage plot tells us that no outlier significantly influences the model fit, as no outlier is outside of Cook’s distance; also, our q-q plot tells us that our residuals are roughly normally distributed towards the middle of the dataset, but the right and left tails of our distribution are a little “light” for what a normal distribution would show.

The histogram of the funds variable shows a relatively normal distribution with a mean of 61.04 millions of dollars received in funding for that year. The distribution of police brutality is mildly skewed to the right, thus I focused on the median rather than the mean to understand the spread of the data better.

<p><strong>The linear regression above shows that there is a slope of -0.3671. In other words, it tells us that, on average, as funding of police departments increases by 1 unit in millions, the number of police brutality incidents reported decreases by about 0.3671 incidents. The standard error tells us that the number of police brutality incidents predicted by the equation of this linear regression line can vary by 0.004496 incidents. Additionally, we see that the p-value for this data set is 2^-16, which indicates that the relationship between these two variables is strong and statistically significant. The residual standard error reported is 0.9464, which means that the average amount that the response (police brutality) will deviate from the true regression line is about 0.9464 incidents, on average. R squared tells us that roughly 97% of the variance found in the response variable (police brut) can be explained by the predictor variable (funding).</strong></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Report the estimated coefficient, standard error, and p-value of the slope. Is the relationship between funds and incidents statistically significant? Explain.</li>
</ol>
<p>__See above answer for the reporting of all these values (sorry about the confusion). We know that the relationship between funds and incidents is statistically significant because the p-value is much smaller than 0.05, which is the cut off for statistical significance that most statisticians use. We also can tell that the relationship is statistically significant because the regression summary tells us that the significance is three stars (***).__</p>

<p><strong>The line looks like a pretty good fit for the data. It appears as a good fit because most of the data points on the graph fall on this line, and those that do not fall on the line don’t seem to deviate wildly from it. However, it is important to note that it looks like the regression line is better for predicting the middle values rather than values on either of the tail ends.</strong></p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Are the four assumptions of linear regression satisfied? To answer this, draw the relevant plots. (Write a maximum of one sentence per assumption.) If not, what might you try to do to improve this (if you had more time)?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>When plotting the residuals vs x plot, we see a pretty clear U-shaped pattern. Unfortunately, this indicates that there may be a failure of independence between the errors in the true underlying regression model; thus, the independence assumption is not satisfied for this data set. Looking at the Residuals vs Fitted plot, we see that the red line is pretty curved, not flat. This tells us that there is a discernible non-linear trend to the residuals and therefore the linearity assumption is not satisfied. As for the scale location plot, we again see a pretty strong curve, rather than a flat line; this tells us that the residuals have non-constant variance and therefore the homoscedasticity assumption is not satisfied. The leverage plot tells us that no outlier significantly influences the model fit, as no outlier is outside of Cook’s distance; however, the q-q plot tells us that the residuals skew pretty extremely to the left. Thus, the normal population assumption is not met for this linear regression.</strong></p>

<li>Answer the question of interest based on your analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Based on the above linear regression analysis, we cannot confidently say that there is linear relationship between police department funding and police brutality incidents. In other words, it cannot be said that changes in police department funding directly correlates to the number of police brutality incidents.</strong></p>

<h3>Problem 3: Data ethics (10 points)</h3>
<p>Describe the dataset. Considering our lecture on data ethics, what concerns do you have about the dataset? Once you perform your analysis to answer the question of interest using this dataset, what concerns might you have about the results?</p>
<p><strong>Although the dataset above was collected by researchers, it still relies on police departments to report accurate and truthful numbers of incidents of police brutality. Relying on the police departments to do this is risky, as the true number of incidents is probably higher than what is reported. This could be due to the fact that police do not want their department to look bad, or because policemen have different interpretations of what qualifies as police brutality. It also could be due to the fact that it is favorable for police to report less incidents when they have higher funding, as it may persuade the public or government to allocate more monetary resources to police departments to avoid brutality incidents. This is a clear conflict of interests. Additionally, as covered in our data ethics lecture, decades of research has shown that police databases are not a complete census of all criminal offences, nor do they constitute a representative random sample. Thus, I have concerns that the dataset is biased, either explicitly or implicitly. My concerns regarding the results are that at a first glance, it seems like there is a strong correlation between funding and brutality incidents and this relationship is one that media may jump to report on. However, once we do proper analysis of the data, we see that using a linear model to predict this relationship is actually quite problematic. Thus, people who do not do proper analysis may incorrectly conclude that there is a definite negative linear relationship between police department funding and police brutality.</strong></p>
